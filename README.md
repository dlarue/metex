# Metex Digital Multimeter Software
Scripts and programs that can be used to connect to a Metext M-3850D DMM via RS-232 and periodically read the values of the meter.
It's quite slow, roughly 1 measurement per second ;-).

Note, that a straight cable is required for the serial connection, not a null-modem cable.

## metex.py
Python script that reads the values from the meter.

It contains two scope programms, one for DOS and one for Windows.
